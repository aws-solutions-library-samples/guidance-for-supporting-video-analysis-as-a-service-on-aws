 # Note 
 (note will be removed when the IG is migrated to its  final destination)
 
 Since we currently lack the permission to gitlab, this `implementation_guide` folder is used temporarily as a place holder for our guidance's Implementation Guide(IG) gitlab repo. The content of the folder will eventually be migrated to another repo. 

See [IG preview of fathom](https://implementationguides.kits.eventoutfitters.aws.dev/proj-fathom-1127/ai-ml/project-fathom.html#) for an idea of overall content structure. 

Two examples of IG from other guidances for reference:
